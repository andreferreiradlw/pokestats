I welcome all contributions from the community. There are many ways to contribute:

## Bug reports

If you are submitting a :bug: bug report, please:

- Use a clear and descriptive title. Describe the behavior you observed and the expected behavior;
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem. A minimal reproduction repo is greatly appreciated;
- Include Node version, OS, Browser or other information that may be helpful in the troubleshooting.

## Process on submitting a PR

_Generally, all external pull requests should have references to an issue._

If you are :sparkles: **adding a new feature** or :zap: **improving an algorithm**, please first [create an issue](../../issues/new) for discussion.

The steps to submit a PR are:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device.

2. Install all dependencies with `yarn install`.

3. Make changes and commit (following the commit message guidelines).

4. Make sure your code is linted by running `yarn run lint`, you can also run `yarn run prettier` to format your code.

5. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

## Javascript style

`PokeStats.gg` uses [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components). Please run `yarn run lint` and fix any linting warnings and `yarn run prettier` to format your code.

## Commits

- Use the present tense and imperative mood ("Add feature" instead of "Adds feature" or "Added feature");
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji (ex. [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me)) for a more beautiful world :rainbow:.
